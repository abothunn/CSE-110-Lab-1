# User Page About Me
Hi, my name is **Ashton Bothun** and I'm currently a **Third Year Computer Science Major at UCSD**

I feel very passionate about technology and software engineering and hope to gain more experience through this class to hopefully land an internship. 

Here is a print statement in my favorite programming language, Python, `print('Hello, World!')` 

Some things about me are that I'm a San Diego local and make a thirty minute commute every day, I love playing tennis, spending time with friends, the automotive scene, and *Pokémon*!

Fun fact, I recently bought a used 3DS XL from Ebay just to play *Pokémon* again! I also jailbroke and modded it using steps from the site (also uses Github for version control and collaboration) [3DS Hacks Guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/).

One of my favorite quotes is by Roger Federer, speeking on his experience during a retirement ceramony,
> Effortless is a myth.
